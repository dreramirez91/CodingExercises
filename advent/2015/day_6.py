    # ! In Python, when you append a list to another list,
    # ! you're appending a reference to that list, not a copy of it.
    # ! So, when you're appending the row list to lights, all rows in
    # ! lights end up referring to the same list object. To solve this
    # ! you need to create a new row variable for each iteration of the loop.
